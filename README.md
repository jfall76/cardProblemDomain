Model a Game of War

Cards are distributed randomly from 1 deck of cards containing 52 cards to each player.
Each player should receive 26 cards each.
Each player draws a card from their deck.
The cards are compared and the player with the higher ranked card gets a point.
If the rank of each card is equal, neither player receives a point.
The cards are then discarded.
This continues until both players have distributed all of their cards.
The player with the higher point total wins.
If the point totals of each player is even, the game is considered a tie.
